# Autonomous Driving Feature - Car Detection using You Only Look Once (YOLO) ALgorithm

This is an assignment in the course Convolutional Neural Networks (Course 4 of Deep Learning Specialization) by ANdrew Ng of DeepLearning.ai.

It implements a pre-trianed *You Only Look Once (YOLO)* algorithm, a state-of-the-art, advanced algorithm for object detection in images.
